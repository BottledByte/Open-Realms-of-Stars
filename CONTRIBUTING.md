## How to contribute

If you wish to contribute the project you should first try it out. See a bit
how game mechanics works. Easiest way to contribute is simple play the game
and if you find a bug just make a bug to Project's GitHub page. Before posting
new bug check that there are no duplicates.

If you want to add new code fork the project make the change. Run JUnits and
checkstyle before committing. These can be run with ``mvn verify``. After this make
pull request back to me.

### Guide lines for making pull requests

 * Pull request should contain single logical change.
 * Coding styling change should be on separate pull requests.
 * Commit messages should be descriptive. If you are fixing an issue start commit line with #ISSUENUMBER.
 * Pull request should not contain merge commits from other branches.
 * Contributors retain their original copyrights. All code contributions must be under GPL2.0.

I'll try to looking these as fast as I can. When
added new assets see paragram one below more instructions.

### Contributing assets

Graphics should be licensed with CC-BY-SA and Sounds/Music with CC-BY. Also CC-BY-SA
for music and sounds is okay, but the credits page must be then changed.
Fonts needs to be licensed with SIL Open Font License.

If you are adding attribute that is not your own work, it's original license must be verified.
Therefore original link needs mentioned in pull request.

#### Adding the credits

Add new credits information to `AUTHORS.md`. They will be automatically incorporated into the game.
